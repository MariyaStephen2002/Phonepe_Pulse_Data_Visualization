Phonepe-Data-Visualization-And-Exploration
The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves:


1. Data Extraction:
Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.


2. Data Transformation:
Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

3. Database Insertion:
Storing transformed data in a POSTGRESQL database.

4. Dashboard Creation:
Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

5. Data Retrieval:
Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.

6. Deployment:
Thorough testing before deploying the dashboard for public access. The outcome is a live geo visualization dashboard presenting insights from the data, enhancing skills in coding, data handling, visualization, and deployment. The project showcases proficiency in these areas, providing practical learning experiences.
